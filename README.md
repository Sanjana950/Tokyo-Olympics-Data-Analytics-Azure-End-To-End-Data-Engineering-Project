# Tokyo Olympics Data Analytics Azure End-To-End Data Engineering Project

## Introduction
The **Tokyo Olympics Analytics Project** demonstrates the implementation of an **end-to-end data engineering pipeline** using **Microsoft Azure services**. The project focuses on ingesting, transforming, and visualizing large volumes of data related to the **Tokyo Olympics**, providing actionable insights via an interactive **Power BI dashboard**.

The project covers the complete data lifecycle, from **data ingestion** using **Azure Data Factory** to **data transformation** using **Azure Databricks** and **data modeling** using **Azure Synapse Analytics**. The final insights are presented through **Power BI**, making it a comprehensive solution for scalable analytics.

## Project Architecture
The architecture of this project involves several Azure services working together to build a scalable, reliable, and efficient data pipeline:

### **Key Components**
1. **GitHub:** The projectâ€™s primary code repository and source for input datasets.
2. **Azure Data Factory (ADF):** Orchestrates the ingestion of raw data from GitHub to **Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2**.
3. **Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2:** Stores both raw and transformed data in structured and unstructured formats.
4. **Azure Key Vault:** Provides secure storage and access to secrets (e.g., storage account keys and Databricks credentials).
5. **Azure Databricks:** Performs data transformation using **PySpark** and saves the transformed data in **Parquet format**.
6. **Azure Synapse Analytics (Serverless SQL):** Creates views over the transformed Parquet data, enabling seamless querying.
7. **Power BI:** Visualizes data insights through interactive dashboards.

This architecture ensures a **scalable**, **secure**, and **cost-effective** way of handling large datasets while making the analytics pipeline easily maintainable.

## **Project Workflow**
1. **Data Ingestion**: Raw data is pulled from GitHub using **Azure Data Factory** and stored in the **raw-data container** in Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2.
2. **Data Transformation**: Using **Databricks with PySpark**, the raw data is transformed and stored in Parquet format within the **transformed-data container**.
3. **Data Modeling**: Views are created in **Azure Synapse Analytics** using **serverless SQL** for easy querying.
4. **Data Visualization**: **Power BI dashboards** display key metrics, such as medal counts, athlete participation, gender distribution, and performance by continent.
